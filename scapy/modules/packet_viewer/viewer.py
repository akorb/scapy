    A packet viewer for Scapy. Based on urwid this class can visualize packets.
    This viewer is extendable and customizable.
    The following configurations are used internally:
        conf.contribs["packet_viewer_custom_views"]
        conf.contribs["packet_viewer_columns"]

    Customize views:
        Derive a custom view from DetailsView and implement
        the desired behaviour. Add your view as list to the configuration.
        conf.contribs["packet_viewer_custom_views"] = [myCustomView]

        CustomViews can also be given to the Viewer directly:
        ```Viewer(source, views=[myCustomView])```

    Customize columns:
        The configuration of conf.contribs["packet_viewer_columns"] contains
        a dictionary where the key is the basecls of a packet. This allows
        you to customize the packet_viewer columns dependent on a basecls.
        A column description is defined as a list of tuples where every
        tuple defines a column.
        The definition of a column consists of a string for the name, an int
        for the column width and a function for the determination of
        the content. Example:
        ```
        src_col = ("SRC", 15, lambda p: p.src)
        dst_col = ("DST", 15, lambda p: p.dst)
        # assign column definitions to IP packets
        conf.contribs["packet_viewer_columns"][IP] = [src_col, dst_col]
        ```
        Now the packet_viewer shows the default columns, followed by
        this custom columns if a basecls is provided.
        A identical configuration can be given to the constructor to customize
        the columns even more. Example:
        ```
        Viewer(source, columns=[src_col, dst_col])
        ```
        Attention: This requires that every packet from the source has the
        attributes `src` and `dst`.
